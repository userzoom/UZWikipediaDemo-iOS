The skier uses a kite to give them power over large jumps. The sport is similar to water-based kiteboarding, but with the footwear used in snowboarding or skiing. The principles of using the kite are the same, but in different terrain. In the early days of snowkiting, foil kites were the most common type; nowadays many kiteboarders use inflatable kites. However, since 2013, newly developed racing foil kites seem to dominate speed races and expedition races, like Red Bull Ragnarok and the Vake mini-expedition race. Snowkiting differs from other alpine sports in that it is possible for the snowkiter to travel uphill and downhill with any wind direction. Like kiteboarding, snowkiting can be very hazardous and should be learned and practiced with care. Snowkiting is becoming increasingly popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden and the Northern and Central United States. The sport is becoming more diverse as adventurers use kites to travel great distances and sports enthusiasts push the boundaries of freestyle, big air, speed and back country exploration.<\/p>","dir":"ltr","timestamp":"2020-12-06T11:04:23Z","wikibase_item":"Q765992","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"displaytitle":"Snowkiting","revision":"992646186","type":"standard","title":"Snowkiting","titles":{"display":"Snowkiting","canonical":"Snowkiting","normalized":"Snowkiting"},"extract":"Snowkiting or kite skiing is an outdoor winter sport where people use kite power to glide on snow or ice. The skier uses a kite to give them power over large jumps. The sport is similar to water-based kiteboarding, but with the footwear used in snowboarding or skiing. The principles of using the kite are the same, but in different terrain. In the early days of snowkiting, foil kites were the most common type; nowadays many kiteboarders use inflatable kites. However, since 2013, newly developed racing foil kites seem to dominate speed races and expedition races, like Red Bull Ragnarok and the Vake mini-expedition race.

Su Dingfang's army defeated Helu at the battle of Irtysh River.","normalizedtitle":"Conquest of the Western Turks","lang":"en","thumbnail":{"width":320,"height":222,"source":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/a9\/Conquest_of_Western_Turks.png\/320px-Conquest_of_Western_Turks.png"},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"edit":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks?action=edit","revisions":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks?action=history","talk":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks","page":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks"},"mobile":{"edit":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks?action=edit","revisions":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:History\/Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks","talk":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks","page":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Conquest_of_the_Western_Turks"}},"tid":"579d22f0-5443-11eb-9a18-d7e3879ad25e","originalimage":{"width":1062,"height":736,"source":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a9\/Conquest_of_Western_Turks.png"}},{"description":"ancient Buddhist kingdom on the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert","thumbnail":{"width":320,"height":160,"source":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d0\/Tarimbecken_3._Jahrhundert.png\/320px-Tarimbecken_3._Jahrhundert.png"},"displaytitle":"Kucha","lang":"en","title":"Kucha","tid":"44b32c50-56e3-11eb-b878-a15d0bf6c62a","description_source":"local","dir":"ltr","extract":"Kucha or Kuche, was an ancient Buddhist kingdom located on the branch of the Silk Road that ran along the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin and south of the Muzat River.","normalizedtitle":"Kucha","revision":"999640016","wikibase_item":"Q1328546","content_urls":{"desktop":{"edit":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kucha?action=edit","revisions":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kucha?action=history","talk":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Kucha","page":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kucha"},"mobile":{"edit":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kucha?action=edit","revisions":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Special:History\/Kucha","talk":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Kucha","page":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kucha"}},"type":"standard","pageid":863644,"extract_html":"<p><b>Kucha<\/b> or <b>Kuche<\/b>, was an ancient Buddhist kingdom located on the branch of the Silk Road that ran along the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin and south of the Muzat River.<\/p>","timestamp":"2021-01-11T05:32:25Z","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"titles":{"display":"Kucha","canonical":"Kucha","normalized":"Kucha"},"coordinates":{"lat":41.715555559999999,"lon":82.93222222},"originalimage":{"width":2114,"height":1059,"source":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/d0\/Tarimbecken_3._Jahrhundert.png"}},{"description":"Tang dynasty conquest","thumbnail":{"width":320,"height":210,"source":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/f0\/Emperor_Taizong%27s_campaign_against_Xiyu_states.svg\/320px-Emperor_Taizong%27s_campaign_against_Xiyu_states.svg.png"},"displaytitle":"Tang campaign against Kucha","lang":"en","title":"Tang_campaign_against_Kucha","tid":"56f60d80-5443-11eb-a9bc-3de32f0bb68f","description_source":"local","dir":"ltr","extract":"The Tang campaign against Kucha was a military campaign led by the Tang dynasty general Ashina She'er against the Tarim Basin oasis state of Kucha in Xinjiang, which was aligned with the Western Turkic Khaganate.
